\# Introduction to Containers and Docker



\## What is a Container?



A \*\*container\*\* packages an application with its dependencies so it runs in its own isolated sandbox. This ensures the application runs reliably regardless of the host environment.



Key principles:

\- The container can't modify or interact with anything it doesn't need

\- Changes in the container shouldn't affect the host or other containers

\- Applications are isolated to just what they need



\## Containers vs. Virtual Machines



\### Virtual Machines

\*\*What they do:\*\*

\- Simulate physical servers to run multiple "servers" on one machine

\- Enabled by hypervisors (coordinate between VMs and hardware)



\*\*Pros:\*\*

\- Near total isolation

\- Can run different OS than host (e.g., Linux on Windows)

\- Application runs reliably regardless of host



\*\*Cons:\*\*

\- Resource-intensive ("bulky")

\- Require spinning up entire guest OS



\### Containers

\*\*What they do:\*\*

\- Bundle applications with libraries and dependencies

\- Share the underlying OS kernel

\- Provide virtualized view of resources

\- Enabled by container engines (e.g., Docker Engine)



\*\*Pros:\*\*

\- Lightweight (no full OS needed)

\- Fast startup and scaling

\- Portable and standardized

\- Secure through isolation



\*\*Cons:\*\*

\- Less complete isolation than VMs



\### When to Use What

\- \*\*Containers:\*\* Most use cases - efficient isolation without VM overhead

\- \*\*VMs:\*\* When near-total isolation is required



\## Benefits of Containerization



\- \*\*Secure:\*\* Isolation keeps apps protected

\- \*\*Portable:\*\* Write once, run anywhere

\- \*\*Lightweight:\*\* Share host OS kernel

\- \*\*Scalable:\*\* Quick to spin up and scale

\- \*\*Flexible:\*\* Loosely coupled architecture



\## What is Docker?



Docker is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product that uses OS virtualization to deliver software in containers.



\## Docker Objects



\- \*\*Images:\*\* Templates defining everything needed for a container

\- \*\*Containers:\*\* Runnable instances of processes and dependencies

\- \*\*Volumes:\*\* Persistent storage detached from container lifecycle



\## Why Docker Matters



Docker revolutionized software deployment by making containerization accessible and standardized. It enables:

\- Consistent environments from dev to production

\- Efficient resource utilization

\- Rapid deployment and scaling

\- Simplified dependency management

\- Microservices architecture support
