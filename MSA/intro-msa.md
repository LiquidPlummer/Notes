# Microservices Architecture

Microservices Architecture (MSA) is an approach to building software applications as a collection of small, independent services that work together. Unlike traditional monolithic applications where all functionality is built as a single unit, microservices break the application into loosely coupled components. Each service focuses on a specific business capability, runs independently, and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. This architectural style enables organizations to develop, deploy, and scale parts of their application independently, making it particularly valuable for large, complex systems that need to evolve quickly.

## Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic application is built as a single, unified unit where all components—user interface, business logic, and data access—are tightly interconnected within one codebase. All code is deployed together as one package, and components communicate through in-process function calls. While simple for small applications, monoliths become difficult to maintain, scale, and update as they grow larger.

## Traditional Client/Server Architecture

Traditional client/server architecture separates applications into clients (handling UI) and servers (handling business logic and data). The server is typically a monolithic application with a single codebase and centralized database. While straightforward to develop and deploy, this model requires scaling the entire application as one unit and redeploying everything for updates.

## Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Service-Oriented Architecture organizes software as a collection of reusable services that communicate over a network, typically using protocols like SOAP and XML. Services in SOA are often larger, enterprise-level components that share a common communication bus (Enterprise Service Bus or ESB). SOA involves centralized governance, heavier protocols, and services that are broader in scope than microservices.

## Microservices Architecture

Microservices take the service-based approach further by decomposing applications into small, independently deployable services. Each microservice is focused on a single business capability, owns its own data, and communicates with other services through lightweight protocols like REST or message queues. Unlike SOA's centralized ESB, microservices favor decentralized communication and governance. Services can be developed using different technologies, deployed independently, and scaled individually based on demand. This architecture emphasizes autonomy, allowing teams to develop, test, and deploy their services without coordinating releases across the entire system.

## The Tradeoff: Complexity

Breaking a monolith into microservices replaces simple function calls with network communication, introducing new complexities: service discovery, network failures, distributed transactions, data consistency across services, and debugging requests that span multiple services. What was once straightforward in-process logic becomes a distributed system problem.

## Summary: Monolithic vs Microservices

| Monolithic | Microservices |
|------------|---------------|

| • No network latency between components | • Isolated failures (resilience) |
| • Simple data consistency | • Independent deployment |
| **Drawbacks** | **Drawbacks** |
| • Scaling requires duplicating entire app | • Complex distributed system management |
| • Single technology stack | • Network latency and failures |
| • Tightly coupled components | • Difficult data consistency |
