# API Gateway Pattern

## The Problem

In a microservices architecture, clients need to interact with multiple services. Without a gateway, clients must know the location of each service, make multiple requests to different endpoints, handle different protocols, and implement cross-cutting concerns like authentication separately for each service. This creates tight coupling between clients and services, makes the system difficult to evolve, and puts significant complexity on the client side.

## What is an API Gateway?

An API Gateway is a single entry point for all client requests in a microservices system. It acts as a reverse proxy that routes requests to appropriate backend services. Instead of clients calling services directly, they interact with the gateway, which handles routing, composition, and protocol translation. The gateway shields clients from the complexity of the underlying microservices architecture and provides a unified API interface.

## Key Responsibilities

**Request Routing**: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on the URL path, headers, or other criteria.

**Request Composition**: Aggregates data from multiple services into a single response, reducing client round-trips.

**Authentication & Authorization**: Centralizes security checks before requests reach backend services.

**Rate Limiting & Throttling**: Protects services from overload by enforcing request limits per client.

**Protocol Translation**: Converts between different protocols (HTTP to gRPC, REST to GraphQL, etc.).

**Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple instances of a service.

**Caching**: Stores responses to reduce backend load and improve performance.

**Monitoring & Logging**: Centralizes observability for all API traffic.

## Advantages

- **Simplified client code**: Clients only need to know one endpoint
- **Reduced round-trips**: Gateway can aggregate multiple service calls
- **Centralized cross-cutting concerns**: Single place for auth, logging, rate limiting
- **Service encapsulation**: Backend service structure can change without affecting clients
- **Protocol flexibility**: Clients can use one protocol while services use others

## Drawbacks

- **Single point of failure**: If the gateway goes down, all services become unreachable
- **Performance bottleneck**: All traffic flows through one component
- **Increased complexity**: Another system to develop, deploy, and maintain
- **Potential coupling**: Gateway logic can become tightly coupled to backend services

## Common Implementations

- **Kong**: Open-source gateway with plugins for auth, rate limiting, and more
- **AWS API Gateway**: Managed service for creating and managing APIs
- **Azure API Management**: Microsoft's managed gateway service
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: Java-based gateway for Spring applications
- **Netflix Zuul**: JVM-based gateway (now largely replaced by Spring Cloud Gateway)
- **Traefik**: Modern reverse proxy and load balancer with dynamic configuration

## Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern

A variation where you create separate gateways for different client types (web, mobile, IoT). Each gateway is optimized for its specific client's needs, providing tailored APIs rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Mobile clients might need more aggressive data aggregation to reduce bandwidth, while web clients might prefer more granular endpoints.
