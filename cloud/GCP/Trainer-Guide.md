# Trainer Guide
Trainer Guides should contain info for trainers:
 - Important or easily missed concepts
 - Common pitfalls
 - Issues with other artifacts
 - Links to elsewhere

In many cases there may not be a need for a trainer guide doc right now. Use this template as a placeholder in the meantime.
