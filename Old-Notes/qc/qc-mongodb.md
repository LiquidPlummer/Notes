# MongoDB QC Study
 - What is MongoDB?
   - A No-SQL database, as opposed to the very common relational database AKA SQL database. It is a persistence solution which stores data BSON Documents. It is more felxible and easy to begin using than a SQL database. We store data as flexible documents rather than rigid table scema.
 - What is MongoDB Atlas?
   - It is a freemium cloud service provided by MongoDB to run mongodb instances in the cloud.
 - What is Monsgosh (Mongo Shell)?
   - This is a command line interface for connecting to and manipulating a mongoDB instance.
 - What is the Mongodb Java Driver/MongoDB Java API?
   - The API used to connect to and manipulate a mongodb instance from within a java application.
 - What makes MongoDB different from a relational database?
   - Mongo doesn't have a rigidly defined schema, instead stores data as very flexible documents
   - Mongo doesn't enforce referential integrity
   - No use of the Structured Query Language
   - Designed with horizontal scaling in mind, designed with scale-out workloads in mind
 - What are documents?
   - this is the basic unit of storage in Mongo, an analogue to a row or record in a SQL table, formatted as BSON data
 - What are collections?
   - Collections are made up of documents, analogue to a SQL table, but not rigidly defined.
 - What are indexes, and how do they work?
   - These decrease search times by reducing the total number of records to search. An index is made of a B-Tree which contains some portion of the data in the collection. Indexing a field makes searches based on that field much much faster.
 - How does an index speed up mongo database access?
   - See above
 - If indexing a field speeds up querying that collection based on that field, why not add an index on every field in every collection?
   - indexes take up space, duplicate data, and incur a cost when inserting, updating, or deleting
 - What would be a use case for making an index hidden?
   - If we wanted to see the effect of dropping an index with the option to bring it back. Hidden indexes still balance themselves, but no longer get used to speed up queries.
 - What is the primary key of a mongodb collection?
   - _id, this is automatically generated and required, and implies uniqueness
 - What data types are valid for the primary key field?
   - Object, String, Integer, All valid BSON types except arrays.
 - What are embedded documents AKA embedded data?
   - documents nested within another document, BSON objects within BSON objects
   - the nested documents do NOT necessarily have an _id field, and certainly don't require a primary key
 - When would we want to use embedded data?
   - often for 1-to-1 and 1-to-many relations
   - when the data is often consumed as a whole
   - When we are not concerned with duplication
 - What are document references?
   - Analogue of SQL foreign keys, but with no referential integrity.
   - references the value of a field in another collection
 - When would we want to use document references?
   - For many-to-many and 1-to-many relations
   - if we frequently modify that data references avoid modifying duplicated data, or dailing to do so
   - if the data is often consumed in part
   - if we are concerned with duplication
 - Does mongodb enforce referential integrity?
   - no
 - How can you model a one-to-many relation in mongodb?
   - embedded data: the embedded thing is an array of objects
   - document references: with an array of references
 - How can you model a many-to-many relationship in mongodb?
   - With a bi-directional set of 1-to-many relations where either side has an array of references to the other collection
 - How do we use our mongo database in a java application?
   - We access it with the mongodb driver API
 - What are these interfaces for:
   - MongoClient - Represents a mongodb instance or cluster, Object which establishes connection to mongodb instance
   - MongoDatabase - Object which represents a database, allows us to access the collections
   - MongoCollection<> - Object represents a collection within the database, allows us to access documents
   - Document - Object represents one document in a collection and allows us to read it's data
   - Bson - this class helps up generate, parse, and interpret BSON in order to work with documents
 - How do we insert a document into a collection with mongosh?
   - db.collection.insertOne({field: value, field2: value2})
 - How do we insert a document into a collection with Mongo Java Driver?
   - collection.insertOne(document) we insert the document which represents the data
 - How do we insert many documents at once?
   - with the insertMany method which takes in an array of documents
 - How do we delete documents?
   - with the deleteOne or deleteMany method, these take in a filter which represents the documents to delete
 - How do we update documents?
   - with the updateOne or updateMany method, which takes in a filter describing the document(s) to be updated, and the updated data
 - What is the difference between replacing and updating a document?
   - replace involves removing the original from the collection and adding an entirely new entry
   - updating just changes values in an existing document
 - Does MongoDB support transactions?
   - yes, but they are not always necessary, and not even possible unless the database is configured to support them.
 - Why is it not necessary to perform single document updates as part of a transaction?
   - because updates of this nature are atomic just by the design of mongo
 - Why are mongodb indexes defined with an integer value (1, or -1)?
   - This indicates if the index should sort ascending (1) or descending (-1)
 - What is an aggregation pipeline?
   - carry out a set of operations on a group of data in order to transform (or aggregate) the result
 - Are there any non-pipeline aggregations?
   - count()
   - estimatedCount()
   - documentCount()
   - distinct()
