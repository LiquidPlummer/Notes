# React Hello World

This is a quick application made with the following command: `npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react`. We've edited the App.jsx file to show a similar message. Otherwise this is the boilerplate Vite React template. 

Launch this project with the following command: `npm run dev` which starts up a local webserver and serves up your react bundle. That command should produce a link in the console to the running web app. Copy/paste, or ctrl+click the link to see the app running in your browser. Edit App.jsx and see your changes reflected rapidly as the devserver re-builds your app to incorporate your changes.
